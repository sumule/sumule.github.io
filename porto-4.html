          <li><b>Insight<ul>
          <li>Based on Game genre, Indie Games are having the greatest edge in current period. There are many games registered as Indie games has been developed. But based on the sales of genres, Indie is not the leader. Single player, Adventure and Action has the bigger sales rather than Indie games. It Proven by the amount of sales of Adventure and Action that doubled  the Indie Games genre. ($5B and $4B than $2B)</li>
          <li>Game sales based on the title also support our facts above  where Call of Duty Series, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, are covered as action genre that has a high value of sales.</li>
          <li>Leading Game based on playing hours are Dota 2, Counter Strike, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, and the famous Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) that counts as action, adventure is also supporting our previous findings where they are giving the highest sales and playing hours.</li>
          <li>Price proven not to be a matter, it could be proven where the more expensive game such as Rust and Counter Strike: Global Offensive that are pricier than War Thunder and GTA V still has higher playing hours.</li>
          <li>Overall trends based on sales and play hours is not having a high positive difference from previous months from 2011. But there is an interesting trend where in August of some years the hours and sales is rising (August of 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2018).</li>
          </ul></b></li>
          <li><b>Recommendation<ul>
          <li>Action, adventure, single player, are the genres has the biggest sales. But we also couldn’t ignore the Indie genre’s growth of development. We may need to release/collaborate a combination of these genres i.e. Indie - Adventure that published by a famous game developer so that we could cover wider spectrum of user.</li>
          <li>We may want to create an extra engagement where we give an extra discount, promotions, or add-ons bundling such as game skin, suggesting limited edition characters in seasonal periods (Black Friday, Christmas, New Year, Thanksgiving, etc.) to increase sales, playing hours, and positive difference from previous month or year (%) so gradually year by year we could increase our growth.</li>
